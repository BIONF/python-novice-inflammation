python-novice-inflammation
==========================

Introduction to Python for non-programmers using inflammation data.

This fork of the swcarpentry course extends the lessons by adding a part on natively reading/writing files and how to use dictionaries. There's also a bit more on processing text from external sources.

We gave (parts) course with 2 1/2 persons over a span of two days (9-5). We managed to go through all of lesson 1 up to including lesson 9 (Writing a Literature Manager).
